# GoogleApps

GoogleApps is a Scala and Spark project that enabled me to explore new ways to cosume Data with Google Playstore data.

## Installation

To build the project, use the Maven package manager. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory, then execute the following command:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
This command will compile the project and create an executable JAR file.
## Usage

After successfully compiling the project, you can run it using the generated JAR file. Use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
java -jar target/GoogleApps-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Alternatively, you can import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and run it from there.
